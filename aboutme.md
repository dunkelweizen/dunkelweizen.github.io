subtitle: Shifting from Clinical Medicine to Data Science

Hello! My name is Cai George Nowicki. I'll answer to either Cai or George, whichever is easier for you. 

I'm just beginning my journey into data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning models as a student at Lambda School. It's a great program so far! 


### My Story

I attended Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsyvlania. It's a great place to learn academics and critical thinking skills. I credit that school and especially my time on the Forensic Speech Team as the birthplace of many of my best qualities. That's also when I met my beautiful wife. I graduated in 2009 with a Bachelor's of Science in Biology, pre-med concentration, with my sights set on going to medical school. 

Unfortunately, life doesn't always play out as we hope. I didn't manage to get into the medical schools I applied to, and then my daughter was born and my priorities shifted. Instead of taking a gap year and applying again, I moved directly into the workforce. For several years I drifted from entry level job to entry level job, not quite finding where I fit. I worked in several industries, including retail, hospitality, financial data entry, and even custodial. As you can imagine, none of these jobs paid very well and my family and I were always struggling for money. 

I decided I was tired of working those types of jobs and returned to school briefly to earn my CNA certification. It was wonderful to work in clinical medicine like I'd always wanted. I worked as a CNA for just over four years. Despite being a challenging job, both physically and emotionally, being a CNA was incredibly rewarding. This was especially true when I worked in an assisted living facility's dementia care unit. I formed close bonds with my residents and their families and I met people I will never forget. 

However, despite the benefits of the job, it was not something I could continue to do for the rest of my career. It paid only slightly better than the retail and custodial jobs I had held before, and it was taking a much larger toll on me physically and mentally. I made some upward progress at my assisted living facility, but never to a position where I wasn't spending most of my day providing direct patient care. I was frustrated, stressed, and honestly somewhat bored with the repetitive nature of the tasks. 

When I saw the opportunity to attend Lambda School using their Income Share Agreement program, I jumped at the opportunity. Here was my chance to do something analytical, to use my problem-solving skills and be rewarded for them, to have a job where I could be properly rewarded financially. I'm a little ways into the Lambda School Data Science program right now, and it's the best choice I ever made. For the first time in my adult life, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to my finances. I see a life where I'll actually be able to save for my daughter's college education and even have a decent retirement someday. I look forward to career where I continue to use my skills every day to answer questions and solve interesting problems for companies and for society.

With my Life Sciences degree, my background in clinical medicine, and the Data Science skills I am gaining at Lambda School, I plan on working in either public health, epidemiology, or clinical research. All of these fields deal with big data from a health perspective, and I know it'll be the right place for me.
