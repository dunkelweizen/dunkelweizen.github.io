## Data Storytelling Project: My Inspiration

Our project for this unit in the Lambda School Data Science program is a data visualization and storytelling project. I decided I wanted to work with a database of exoplanets. These are planets outside of our Solar System that astronomers have detected using a variety of methods. 

I decided I wanted to do a project involving exoplanet data after I heard about a recent discovery involving the composition of the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, located about 110 light-years from Earth. Astronomers were able to use the Hubble Space Telescope to gather spectrographic data about the atmosphere of this planet. Using this data, they were able to confirm that K2-18b has water vapor in its hydrogen/helium atmosphere. This is the first time water vapor has been determined to exist in a planet outside our Solar System.
    
In addition to an atmosphere containing water vapor, K2-18b also exists within the "habitable zone" of its star. The temperatures on the exoplanet likely range from between -99 and 116 F, temperatures that support life here on Earth. While none of this confirms that K2-18b has any life on its surface, given how close it is to the radiation being given off by its star, it does suggest that conditions which support life can exist on other planets. 
    
I decided to analyze exoplanet data to learn about the characteristics of exoplanets that scientists have already detected. I'm curious to see what characteristics these exoplanets share with Earth and our Sun, and also perhaps see how many of them share characteristics with K2-18b and might also harbor water vapor and habitable temperatures. 
    
This [Universe Today article](https://www.universetoday.com/143372/water-discovered-in-the-atmosphere-of-an-exoplanet-in-the-habitable-zone-it-might-be-rain/) discusses how scientists believe that exoplanets similar to K2-18b are very common in our galaxy. I can use exoplanet data collected by CalTech to examine "Super-Earth" style systems and see how many of those are very much like K2-18b and its associated star. 
    
I need to come up with a hypothesis to test or a way to tell a story about my data. The article mentions that planets orbiting cooler stars can be in the "habitable zone" even very close to their stars, which results in a very short orbital period. Maybe I can do something with this. I still need to think about that.
